# Terminology note:
# The game this module is based on is called '12Riven'; this module being called 'riven12' instead is a deliberate mangling to
# accomodate for python violently disliking identifiers that start with a digit. Accordingly, class names incorporating this
# information are called R12* instead of 12R*.
